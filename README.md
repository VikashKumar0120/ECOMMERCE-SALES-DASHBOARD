# ECOMMERCE SALES DASHBOARD

The aim of the E-commerce Sales Dashboard project was to provide a comprehensive perspective on e-commerce sales performance. This was achieved by creating interactive and visually captivating dashboards using Power BI. These dashboards were tailored to carefully scrutinize and monitor vital Year-to-Date (YTD) metrics, including profit, quantity, profit margin, and sales trends. Leveraging data sourced from the e-commerce platform, these dashboards empowered stakeholders to make well-informed decisions, pinpoint growth opportunities, and assess the effectiveness of their marketing campaigns.
